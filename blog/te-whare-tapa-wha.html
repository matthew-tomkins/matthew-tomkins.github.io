      <h1>THE FOUR DIMENSIONS OF WELLBEING</h1>

      <p>
        Back in 1984, Sir Mason Durie created Te Whare Tapa Whā - a Māori
        approach to health and wellbeing. The concept uses the metaphor of a
        wharenui (meeting house) standing strong on four pillars. When all four
        pillars are solid, the whole structure works - and that's how our hauora
        (wellbeing) functions.

      <h3>TAHA TINANA - Physical Wellbeing</h3>
      <h3>TAHA HINENGARO - Mental and Emotional Wellbeing</h3>
      <h3>TAHA WAIRUA - Spiritual Wellbeing</h3>
      <h3>TAHA WHĀNAU - Family and Social Wellbeing</h3>
      <h3>WHENUA - Connection to Land</h3>

      <p>
        Dev Academy has consciously embraced this philosophy into its learning
        foundation as part of its commitment to Te Tiriti O Waitangi, honouring
        and integrating these principles. They value wellbeing and awareness at
        the heart of their learning journey and what truly represents our
        community in Aotearoa.
