      <h2>THREE NEW THINGS I'VE LEARNED ABOUT MYSELF AND MY EGO</h2>
      <p>
        The biggest shift has been consciously questioning my ego when it shows
        up - recognising when it's getting in the way of learning rather than
        helping. I've learnt that it's completely normal to find something
        difficult, and that difficulty doesn't mean impossibility. A lot of
        people experience it, but most aren’t open and share that difficulty
        with others. The key is catching myself when negative thoughts try to
        take over, and actively working through it rather than letting it shut
        me down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growth mindset has become a tool I incorporate daily rather than just a
        concept. When facing challenges now, I approach them with "ok, I don't
        get it right now but that's cool. I'll find the answer - I can do it"
        rather than immediately assuming something is beyond my capabilities.
        It's shifted from ego protection mode to genuine curiosity about what I
        need to do to solve this.

      <h2>THE ROLE OF VALUES, EMPATHY, AND SELF-AWARENESS</h2>
      <p>
        They all work together as a package that nurtures growth, productivity
        and builds a positive community environment. Values keep you grounded in
        what matters when things get tough. Empathy helps you understand other
        perspectives and collaborate effectively - crucial when you're
        problem-solving with others or even just understanding how other people
        react in situations. Self-awareness lets you recognise your own
        patterns, strengths, and blind spots so you can work with them rather
        than against them. Together, they create the foundation for sustainable
        growth and meaningful contribution to any team or project.

      <h2>WHAT SURPRISED ME MOST</h2>
      <p>
        Mindfulness caught me off guard - how much most days are just a blur
        with life and news constantly demanding attention. Taking a moment to
        actually be present and appreciate where you are right now is really
        powerful and important. Simple things like noticing a butterfly cruising
        past, birds catching worms, or acknowledging the physical feeling of
        warmth from the sun become meaningful when you slow down to actually
        experience them instead of automatically blocking them out.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's such a simple practice but the impact has been amazing. It's like
        discovering there's this whole layer of richness in daily life that I
        was just rushing past without noticing.

      <h2>THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECTS</h2>
      <p>
        The hardest part has been taking time to genuinely reflect on and
        interpret my personal views and natural reactions. It's easy to agree
        with the Human Skills tools and concepts, but really questioning whether
        I actually apply them when things get tough is much more challenging.
        Looking honestly at my auto responses and patterns isn't always
        comfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
        It requires slowing down and being really honest about how I actually
        behave versus how I think I behave. That gap between intention and
        reality can be pretty humbling, but that's where the real growth
        happens.

      <h2>WHY FOCUS ON HUMAN SKILLS IN A PROGRAMMING COURSE?</h2>
      <p>
        It's core preparation for being ready to handle challenges. The course
        is setting up a "can do" ethos before we get hit with heavier workloads
        and serious mental obstacles. Programming isn't just about technical
        knowledge - it's about personal application, problem-solving under
        pressure, and maintaining momentum when things get difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        Human skills are what determine whether you push through the tough
        moments or give up when feeling challenged. Technical skills can be
        learnt, but the mindset to keep going when you're stuck is what actually
        gets you through the learning process and achieve results.

      <h2>WAS THIS TIME WELL SPENT?</h2>
      <p>
        For sure! I've really enjoyed the Human Skills modules, and they've
        directly impacted my progress in a positive way already. Adjusting and
        embracing Growth Mindset has been the most useful tool when confronted
        with technical challenges and exercises.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mentality to continue applying yourself and not give in to "it's too
        hard, it'll always be too hard for me" has been crucial. Coding concepts
        can be researched, repeated, and eventually conquered - but if you give
        up mentally, there's no potential to continue and grow. The human skills
        give you the resilience to stick with the technical learning when it can
        feel impossible in that moment, which is where the real progress and
        personal growth happens.
