      <h1>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE: WHAT IS IT?</h1>
      <p>
        What exactly is Emotional Intelligence?
        <strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong> (or <strong><em>EI</em></strong
        >) is basically your ability to handle your own emotions and understand
        what's going on with other people emotionally. Think of it like strong
        people skills with a conscious awareness of the feelings behind
        everything.

      <h1>THE 5 KEY ELEMENTS</h1>
      <p>There are five main elements that make up Emotional Intelligence:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-awareness</strong> - knowing what you're feeling and why
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-regulation</strong> - managing your emotions instead of
          letting them run wild
        </li>
        <li><strong>Motivation</strong> - staying driven and positive</li>
        <li><strong>Empathy</strong> - understanding how others are feeling</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Social skills</strong> - being good at interacting with people
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Dr. Josh Garrin from Southern New Hampshire University sums the concept
        up well: "Emotional intelligence enables us to ‘walk a mile in someone’s
        shoes,’ which might just be the most important human skill of all”.

      <h1>UNDERSTANDING OTHERS (AND YOURSELF)</h1>
      <p>
        You can't control how other people feel or act, but what you can do is
        try to figure out what emotions are driving their behaviour. Once you
        understand where someone's coming from emotionally, it's much easier to
        navigate how to interact more successfully with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This applies to yourself too. When you take a moment to understand your
        own reactions and think about how they might affect others, you're more
        likely to have an actual conversation rather than finding yourself in
        conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence helps you step back from your own perspective and
        consider how things might look from someone else's point of view. The
        better you get at this, the more you can identify, manage, and even
        predict emotional responses - both yours and other people's.
      </p>

      <h1>IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING OVERLY SENSITIVE</h1>
      <p>
        Having high emotional intelligence doesn't mean you're super sensitive
        or emotional all the time. You might feel things more deeply, and you'll
        probably be more empathetic, but the key difference is that you're
        better at managing those emotions rather than being overwhelmed by them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more emotionally intelligent you become, the better you get at
        understanding feelings - yours and everyone else's.

      <h1>HOW TO GET BETTER AT IT</h1>
      <p>
        Good news! You can work on improving your emotional intelligence with
        some practice. Here are a few things that will help to develop this
        skill:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Slow down your reactions</strong> - Don't just react
          immediately when something triggers you. Take a breath.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Know your strengths and weaknesses</strong> - Be honest about
          what you're good at and what you need to work on.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pay attention to non-verbal communication</strong> - People
          communicate so much through body language, tone of voice, and what
          they don't say.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Work on clear, open communication</strong> - Be genuine about
          how you express yourself and really listen to others.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It's not an impossible skill to develop, but it does take intentional
        effort. The more you practice thinking about emotions - yours and others
        - the more natural it becomes.
