      <h2>
        <strong>Classes</strong> and <strong>IDs</strong>… what's that
        about? Here's a quick introductrion to help get your head around things and
        when to use them.
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        <strong>IDs</strong> are super specific and cannot be reused. It's like
        your home address - it cannot be referenced to navigate anywhere else as
        a final destination. IDs point to one specific location on the webpage,
        or a single function.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>CLASSES</strong> are reusable identifiers that can be applied to
        multiple elements. They're like suburbs - a shared name that encompasses
        many different houses within the same area. You use classes to apply
        consistent styling across elements you want styled the same way
        throughout your website.
      </p>

      <h1><u>IDS</u></h1>

      <p>
        By nature <strong>IDs</strong> have significantly more importance than
        Classes when being processed through the web browser (they have higher
        CSS specificity), and an ID cannot be reused more than once per web
        page. IDs are best for targeting specific elements in an HTML webpage,
        like an anchor tag on a section of a webpage (e.g. 'Our Services').
      </p>

      <h2>USE AN ID WHEN:</h2>
      <ul class="bullet-point">
        <li>
          Creating unique page landmarks (navigation, main content, footer)
        </li>
        <li>Setting up JavaScript interactions for specific elements</li>
        <li>Implementing anchor links within a page</li>
        <li>Targeting elements for automated testing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Below are examples of IDs in HTML and CSS:</p>
      <img
        class="image-border-bright"
        src="../images/ID-example-01.png"
        alt="ID CSS example"
      />
      <br>
      <img
        class="image-border-bright"
        src="../images/ID-example-02.png"
        alt="ID CSS example"
      />

      <p>
        IDs interact with JavaScript and its functioning, and if you're building
        a website using HTML & CSS only, IDs aren't essential but can still be
        useful for styling unique elements.
      </p>

      <article class="blog-div-bright">
        <h1><u>CLASSES</u></h1>

      <p>
        <strong>Classes</strong> are broad but specific to their purpose.
        They're most successfully used for consistent styling and layouts on a
        web page and can be applied as many times to elements as needed. If you
        want to style page section headings (e.g. bold, blue & underlined) this
        can be done in a Class with specific rules defining how it will look.
      </p>

      <h2>USE CLASSES WHEN:</h2>
      <ul class="bullet-point">
        <li>
          Styling multiple elements consistently (buttons, cards, text styles)
        </li>
        <li>Building reusable component styles</li>
        <li>
          Creating modifier variations (.button, .button--large, .button--red)
        </li>
        <li>Working with CSS frameworks or design systems</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Below are examples of Classes in HTML and CSS:</p>
      <img
        class="image-border-bright"
        src="../images/Class-example-01.png"
        alt="Class HTML example"
      />
      <br>
      <img
        class="image-border-bright"
        src="../images/Class-example-02.png"
        alt="“Class HTML example"
      />

        <h2><em>TO SUM IT UP:</em></h2>
        <p>
          Think of IDs as your unique home address and classes as your
          neighborhood. Use IDs sparingly for one-off elements that need
          JavaScript interaction or serve as page landmarks. Use classes liberally
          for styling and creating consistent, reusable components across your
          site. When in doubt, go with classes - they're more flexible and won't
          cause headaches down the road, and can be reused as many times as you
          need.
