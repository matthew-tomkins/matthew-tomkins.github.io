      <h2>A PERSONAL PROBLEM</h2>
      <p>
        This week I had a moment where I questioned everything - how can I do
        JavaScript and why was I doing it? HTML & CSS make sense, I can
        conceptualise it and understand the steps I need to achieve my project
        vision knowing what direction I need to focus more research toward to
        execute it. Being a visual person that all learning clicked.
      </p>
      <p>
        But JavaScript is something else completely. Rules, methods, flow -
        lines and lines of code that do things that make other things do stuff.
        Call back to earlier functions and data, use that to return this, used
        method to target and output jbdkasbd rqpsl axnctfsw… It's a lot to get
        your head and the scale of the code can come be overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Running through the basics of JS was all good - some areas of the
        learning clicked and others were still a bit "eh" but confidence and
        knowledge was on the up. Working through the modules and seeing the
        confidence and application grow was inspiring - I didn't know where I
        was headed but I was proud I kew something. Not a bad place to be at
        'right now' I thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, out of curiosity I peeked ahead at a bit of a milestone exercise -
        The JS Kata. Sweet, there's an intro video I'll take a look at this
        before I sign off for the day. Get a bit of an idea what's happening
        tomorrow and sit on it. Put the learning into action tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buuuut instead of feeling confident as the video played through I
        started questioning things - what am I doing, can I do this, is this
        what I want to do? I spun out quick. My vision of what I wanted to do
        post Dev Academy was questioned hard. Like I said before I'm a visual
        person and lines and lines and more lines, with more lines of code
        wasn't exactly how I saw my professional career in the future. Was I
        going to be locked in a dungeon tapping out code all day?
      </p>
      <p>
        The self doubt hit hard and I was looking for an out. But after stepping
        back and thinking about growth mindset, I realised I was in a fixed
        mindset - being challenged and reacting instead of embracing the
        challenge. So I told myself to chill out and sleep on it. This was all
        part of the process I'd been expecting anyway.

      <h2>APPLYING PROBLEM SOLVING TECHNIQUES</h2>
      <p>
        Next day sun was shining, made a coffee and sat down to begin the days
        studying. Yep, I could already feel a shift from yesterday and my
        purpose being on this journey. I recognised yesterday had been one of
        the moments where I would be challenged eventually. It was good to feel
        and recognise that. I could answer that JavaScript was key in my journey
        and every area of web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started on the 'dreaded' JS KATA and strangely it felt fun, engaging
        and rewarding. It wasn't easy but also wasn't what I thought it was the
        day before - impossible. Some of the "eh's?" became ah-ha's, and the
        "what the"'s became okay - I need to look into this.
      </p>
      <p>
        The process I gravitated toward became a Swiss Army knife of
        problem-solving approaches. I'd always start by reflecting - rereading
        the instructions multiple times and trying to comprehend what I actually
        needed to do when I was at a loss initially. This naturally flowed into
        targeted Google searches to get a general idea of the right functions or
        methods I'd need to use. MDN documentation was a fundamental resource,
        along with blog posts that explained concepts in different ways. Adding
        "Reddit" to the end of search terms was a game changer - seeing real
        people discuss the same problems, sharing pros and cons, made everything
        feel more relatable and less intimidating.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't use pseudocode much initially, but as I progressed through the
        later tests, I started incorporating it both before coding (to plan my
        approach) and after (to break down what I'd actually achieved in simple
        terms). When I was really stumped, I'd turn to Claude.ai - not for
        answers, but to nudge me toward the right research direction. Getting
        general and generic code structure examples really helped put the
        process into context for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peer collaboration was invaluable too. Shoutout to James in Home group
        T(h)ree! Reviewing code and discussing different approaches helped
        clarify my own thinking and gave me alternative problem-solving
        strategies. I found myself naturally talking through problems aloud -
        sometimes leading myself in circles, but often landing on "okay, I need
        to research this specific thing further." I became my own rubber ducky
        many times over.
      </p>
      <p>
        After each test, I'd write reflections about my confidence levels and
        areas I struggled with. Then I would incorporate post-pseudocode which
        was possibly the most valuable - reviewing my written code and
        explaining to myself the what's, how's and why's in plain english.
        Running these reflections through Claude to check for fundamental errors
        in my understanding became a key reinforcement tool, simplifying complex
        concepts in the most basic way possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem solving tools are vast and many. Some were natural and some
        needed to be consciously applied, and developing all of these to fit the
        right purpose and situation is a key part of my learning journey and
        contribution to success.
      </p>
      <p>
        Underneath it all having the growth mindset to take on these challenges
        is the most important. Embrace it, question it and apply yourself to
        your goals. Don't tap out because it's hard and persevere because it's
        the purpose.
