      <h2>LONG TERM GOAL AND CAREER PATHWAY</h2>

      <p>
        My vision has become clearer since starting this journey. I want to
        develop full stack capabilities, incorporating my previous design study
        and professional experience into web development. The creative side that
        got shut down in corporate management roles is coming back to life, and
        I can see how to blend that with technical skills. I know I will always
        continue to learn and up skill after completing the course, and the self
        study skills to embrace that are really the most important aspect of
        being at Dev Academy in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        My destination is either freelancing as a full stack developer -
        building that "shop" I mentioned in my original learning plan - or
        joining a team in a company with positive culture. If I go the team
        route, I'm open to either junior roles where I can gain more technical
        experience, or management positions where I can draw on my previous
        professional experience to lead projects and support other developers.
        Both paths excite me, and I'm keeping options open as I see what feels
        right during Bootcamp and opportunities that are available post study.

      <h2>BIGGEST STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS IN BOOTCAMP</h2>

      <p>
        Looking back at my original assessment, my strengths remain the same but
        have grown stronger through Foundations. People skills and project
        management are definitely my core strengths. The remote work experience
        I mentioned has proven valuable for time management and self-discipline.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main limitation is still developing my coding knowledge. While I've
        made solid progress through Foundations, I know the technical demands in
        Bootcamp will be challenging. I'm still building confidence in my
        problem-solving approach when the code isn't working, though the Human
        Skills learning has helped with the mindset side of this challenge. I'm
        much better at staying curious rather than frustrated when things get
        difficult.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="blog-div-bright">
      <h2>BIGGEST NON-TECHNICAL CHALLENGE IN BOOTCAMP</h2>

      <p>
        My main concern is staying focused and keeping up with the material and
        exercises through Bootcamp. I'm still feeling a bit of imposter syndrome
        - that gap between where I am now and where I feel I should be
        technically. The pace is going to ramp up significantly, and I want to
        make sure I don't fall behind or let that self-doubt creep in when
        things get challenging.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've proven I can manage the Foundations pace, but Bootcamp will be on
        another level. Maintaining momentum and confidence when the workload
        intensifies will be my biggest hurdle.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="blog-div-dark">
      <h2>HUMAN SKILLS I WANT TO DEVELOP</h2>

      <p>
        I want to continue developing confidence and self-belief using growth
        mindset as my foundation - this has been the most valuable tool from
        Foundations. When I hit technical walls (which I will), I need to keep
        that "ok, I don't get it right now but that's cool, I'll find the
        answer" mentality strong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Better problem-solving application is key - not just getting through
        exercises, but really understanding the process so I can apply it to new
        challenges. I also want to get better at incorporating reflections to
        strengthen my learnings. The habit of stepping back and processing what
        worked, what didn't, and why needs to become more automatic.
      </p>

      <h2>EXPECTATIONS FROM THE BOOTCAMP TEAM</h2>

      <p>
        More of the same from Foundations - the support and positive community
        environment at Dev Academy has been awesome. The facilitation team has
        been responsive, kind and helpful which has provided me with a lot of
        growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm looking forward to working with the whole cohort rather than just my
        home group. Starting the course in the smaller home group Tree has been
        great and I feel I lucked into a truly lovely and supportive crew. While
        we’re all so different we compliment each other and have provided a lot
        of support in tough times. Incorporating that energy and collaboration
        with more people should be inspiring and push everyone to lift their
        game. I expect the team to maintain that balance of challenge and
        support that's made Foundations work so well.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="blog-div-dark blog-div-last-dark">
      <h2>EXPECTATIONS OF MYSELF IN BOOTCAMP</h2>

      <p>
        I'm committed to applying myself fully and working through challenges
        and not giving up when things get tough. I want to be a positive
        contribution to the cohort - someone who lifts others up and creates
        good energy in the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll use emotional intelligence to amplify productivity for myself and
        others. This means reading the room, knowing when to ask for help, when
        to offer help, and when to step back and let others lead. I've learned
        in previous professional roles that managing your own energy and
        supporting others energy is crucial for team success.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I need help, I'll seek it early rather than struggling and falling
        behind. I'll manage my workload by staying organised, communicating
        clearly with the cohort and facilitators, and maintaining that balance
        between pushing through challenges and knowing when to reach out. The
        "power nap and breather" from my original plan will be so important when
        the intensity increases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, I'm committed to staying curious and maintaining that
        growth mindset when the technical challenges feel overwhelming. That's
        going to be the foundation that gets me through the next nine weeks and
        sets me up for success beyond Dev Academy.

      <h1>LONG TERM GOAL / CAREER PATHWAY</h1>
      <p>
        At the moment I am not 100% sure which career pathway I want to pursue
        and still exploring this as I progress sthrough studying. But I have a
        few goals I want to tick whatever this leads to.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make my work life gratifying and stimulating</li>
        <li>Working with an inspiring and positive team</li>
        <li>Developing projects I find engaging</li>
        <li>The opportunity to contribute and help others grow</li>
        <li>To not be confined to 4 walls to be successful.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The two most likely pathways I have envisioned are integrating myself
        into a team where I can contribute and grow - entry level or management,
        or start up my own “shop” incorporating a full stack product to clients.

      <h1>LEARNING STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS</h1>
      <p>
        A key strength is an enthusiasm toward web development, and
        determination to fully commit to the course. I have wanted to study web
        development when I was freelancing as a graphic designer a few years
        back now, and found myself building front end websites using WordPress
        and Elementor. I quickly realised my aspirations exceeded my (and the
        Elementor functions) capabilities and knowledge. I loved the work I just
        was skilled enough to do what I envisioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have blocked out the 19 week period with the course learning as my #1
        priority, and see this time as a stepping stone toward the next stage of
        my professional career.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the last 6 months I have proven to be capable of working remotely
        and managing my time, working for a national company with the head
        office in Auckland, and myself alone in Christchurch. I see this as a
        strength to study remotely and meet timelines here in the Dev Academy
        course.

      <h1>
        WHAT SKILLS (NON-TECHNICAL/HUMAN SKILLS) I WANT TO DEVELOP WHILE AT DEV
        ACADEMY?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Critical thinking and problem solving - develop more confidence on and
        be more successful at it. I’ve already started to think of real life
        situation problem solving in a web developer thought process. I want to
        keep growing this part of my brain.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really want to tap back in to my creative nature and lifestyle more.
        After working in an office doing management duties in an industry I
        didn’t fully engage with I realised recently I ‘veshut that part of
        myself down over time. I love music and want to get my DJ set up dusted
        off and make time again for mixing a few beats and tunes in the bedroom
        haha.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also want to be more disciplined and look after my physical well being
        better. Dedicate time to regular exercise (I joined the gym) and commit
        to a healthier diet. I love cooking, I’m working on less takeaways and
        better portion control to integrate for a healthier future.

      <h1>HOW WILL I MANAGE MY WORKLOAD IN THIS PROGRAMME?</h1>
      <p>
        To work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives I am committed to respecting and
        listening to others, and processing constructive feedback as an
        opportunity to grow. I will contribute to projects and learning, and
        ensure to put the team first.
      </p>
      <p>
        When things are building up, I will take a Power Nap and have a breather
        when I am starting to feel overwhelmed. Sometimes a minute to chill and
        refocus when your brain is overloaded is a quick fix and recalibrate. If
        I recognise I am struggling with the learning content, and facing
        behind, I feel comfortable reaching out to the facilitation team or
        checking in with my home group for help and guidance.

    <article class="blog-div-bright">
      <h1>MY COMMITMENT TO SEEKING HELP</h1>

      <p>
        As I touched on ^ I am focussed on developing my critical thinking and
        problem solving skills - especially toward web development. I can see
        this will be crucial in the future working in the industry or on
        personal projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here in the Dev Academy learning community, I have already found
        help and guidance from the facilitators and my fellow young people
        students. In a remote study environment, it’s finding the balance
        between working through problems and reaching out to others. I have no
        hesitation to put my hand up when time management and learning content
        comprehension are being compromised.

        I’ve already found the facilitation team as responsive, kind and
        helpful. This is really my key expectation and so far it’s been proven
        to be true and in no doubt that will change.
