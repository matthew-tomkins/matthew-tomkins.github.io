      <h1>LONG TERM GOAL / CAREER PATHWAY</h1>
      <p>
        At the moment I am not 100% sure which career pathway I want to pursue
        and still exploring this as I progress sthrough studying. But I have a
        few goals I want to tick whatever this leads to.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make my work life gratifying and stimulating</li>
        <li>Working with an inspiring and positive team</li>
        <li>Developing projects I find engaging</li>
        <li>The opportunity to contribute and help others grow</li>
        <li>To not be confined to 4 walls to be successful.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The two most likely pathways I have envisioned are integrating myself
        into a team where I can contribute and grow - entry level or management,
        or start up my own “shop” incorporating a full stack product to clients.

      <h1>LEARNING STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS</h1>
      <p>
        A key strength is an enthusiasm toward web development, and
        determination to fully commit to the course. I have wanted to study web
        development when I was freelancing as a graphic designer a few years
        back now, and found myself building front end websites using WordPress
        and Elementor. I quickly realised my aspirations exceeded my (and the
        Elementor functions) capabilities and knowledge. I loved the work I just
        was skilled enough to do what I envisioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have blocked out the 19 week period with the course learning as my #1
        priority, and see this time as a stepping stone toward the next stage of
        my professional career.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the last 6 months I have proven to be capable of working remotely
        and managing my time, working for a national company with the head
        office in Auckland, and myself alone in Christchurch. I see this as a
        strength to study remotely and meet timelines here in the Dev Academy
        course.

      <h1>
        WHAT SKILLS (NON-TECHNICAL/HUMAN SKILLS) I WANT TO DEVELOP WHILE AT DEV
        ACADEMY?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Critical thinking and problem solving - develop more confidence on and
        be more successful at it. I’ve already started to think of real life
        situation problem solving in a web developer thought process. I want to
        keep growing this part of my brain.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really want to tap back in to my creative nature and lifestyle more.
        After working in an office doing management duties in an industry I
        didn’t fully engage with I realised recently I ‘veshut that part of
        myself down over time. I love music and want to get my DJ set up dusted
        off and make time again for mixing a few beats and tunes in the bedroom
        haha.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also want to be more disciplined and look after my physical well being
        better. Dedicate time to regular exercise (I joined the gym) and commit
        to a healthier diet. I love cooking, I’m working on less takeaways and
        better portion control to integrate for a healthier future.

      <h1>HOW WILL I MANAGE MY WORKLOAD IN THIS PROGRAMME?</h1>
      <p>
        To work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives I am committed to respecting and
        listening to others, and processing constructive feedback as an
        opportunity to grow. I will contribute to projects and learning, and
        ensure to put the team first.
      </p>
      <p>
        When things are building up, I will take a Power Nap and have a breather
        when I am starting to feel overwhelmed. Sometimes a minute to chill and
        refocus when your brain is overloaded is a quick fix and recalibrate. If
        I recognise I am struggling with the learning content, and facing
        behind, I feel comfortable reaching out to the facilitation team or
        checking in with my home group for help and guidance.

    <article class="blog-div-bright">
      <h1>MY COMMITMENT TO SEEKING HELP</h1>

      <p>
        As I touched on ^ I am focussed on developing my critical thinking and
        problem solving skills - especially toward web development. I can see
        this will be crucial in the future working in the industry or on
        personal projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here in the Dev Academy learning community, I have already found
        help and guidance from the facilitators and my fellow young people
        students. In a remote study environment, it’s finding the balance
        between working through problems and reaching out to others. I have no
        hesitation to put my hand up when time management and learning content
        comprehension are being compromised.

      <h1>MY EXPECTATIONS FROM THE FACILITATION TEAM</h1>
      <p>
        I’ve already found the facilitation team as responsive, kind and
        helpful. This is really my key expectation and so far it’s been proven
        to be true and in no doubt that will change.
