      <h1>JAVASCRIPT & ITS RELATIONSHIP TO HTML AND CSS</h1>

      <h3>HTML + CSS + JS = the holy trinity of the web</h3>

      <p>
        In web development these three core three languages work together as a
        team - highly complimentary but completely separate. You write them in
        different files, then have your HTML document call in the other two when
        a webpage loads.
      </p>

      <p>
        So if HTML defines what content is on a webpage and CSS makes that
        content look good... what does JavaScript do?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >JavaScript is what brings real interactivity to a web page</strong
        >
        - it responds to clicks, hovers, form submissions, and can change
        content on the page without needing to reload. Its main purpose is to
        bridge the gap between static web content and dynamic user experiences.

      <h1>CONTROL FLOW AND LOOPS</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>Flow</strong> is how your JavaScript code makes decisions and
        moves through different paths. Think about making your morning coffee:
        you check if there's coffee in the machine - if yes, press brew; if no,
        add coffee first, then press brew. That's control flow - your code
        following logical decision paths.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Loops</strong> are when you need to repeat the same action
        multiple times. Using the coffee example: imagine you're making coffee
        for 5 people. Instead of writing "make coffee" five separate times,
        you'd create a loop that says "make coffee, count one person, repeat
        until you've made 5 cups." Here's what that looks like in code:
      </p>

      <div class="codeExample-box">
        <pre><code class="codeFont">
for (let cups = 1; cups <= 5; cups++) {
    console.log("Making coffee cup number: " + cups);
}
        </code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        This loop counts from 1 to 5, making a coffee each time without you
        having to write repetitive code.

      <h1>ARRAYS VS OBJECTS - ACCESSING DATA</h1>

      <p>
        Think of <strong>Arrays</strong> like a numbered shopping list. Each
        item has a position (starting from 0), and you access items by their
        position number:
      </p>

      <div class="codeExample-box">
        <pre><code class="codeFont">
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
console.log(fruits[0]); <em>// Gets "apple" (first item)</em>
console.log(fruits[2]); <em>// Gets "orange" (third item)</em>
          </code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>Objects</strong> are more like a contact card where each piece
        of info has a specific label - technically these are called Keys. You
        access information by using the label name:
      </p>

      <div class="codeExample-box">
        <pre><code class="codeFont">
let person = {
  name: "Sarah",
  age: 25,
  email: "sarah@email.com"
};
console.log(person.name); <em>// Gets "Sarah"</em>
console.log(person.age);  <em>// Gets 25</em>
          </code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Arrays are great for lists of similar things (like a shopping list),
        while objects are perfect for storing related information about one
        thing (information about a person).
      </p>

      <h1>FUNCTIONS (AND WHY THEY'RE USEFUL)</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>Functions</strong> are custom commands you create to do specific
        jobs. Think of them like creating your own recipe - you write the
        instructions once, then you can follow that recipe whenever you need it.
      </p>

      <div class="codeExample-box">
        <pre><code class="codeFont">
function greetPerson(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to our website.";
}

<em>// Now you can use this function anywhere</em>
console.log(greetPerson("Matt")); <em>// "Hello, Matt! Welcome to our website.”</em>
console.log(greetPerson("Sarah")); <em>// "Hello, Sarah! Welcome to our website.”</em>
        </code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Instead of writing the greeting code over and over, you write it once in
        a function and just call it whenever needed. This makes your code way
        more efficient, easier to maintain, and if you need to change how
        greetings work, you only update it in one place.

      <h1>THE DOM AND INTERACTION</h1>

      <p>
        The DOM (Document Object Model) is how JavaScript sees and interacts
        with your webpage. It's basically a family tree that maps out every
        element on your page - every heading, paragraph, button, and image gets
        its own spot in this tree structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's an example: let's say you want to change the text of a button
        when someone clicks it. JavaScript uses the DOM to grab that specific
        button element and modify it:
      </p>

      <div class="codeExample-box">
        <pre><code class="codeFont">
<em>// Find the button on the page</em>
let myButton = document.getElementById("clickMe");

<em>// Change what happens when it's clicked</em>
myButton.onclick = function() {
    myButton.innerHTML = "Thanks for clicking!";
};
        </code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        The DOM is the bridge that lets your JavaScript target and manipulate
        what people see and interact with on your website.

      <h1>DEVTOOLS - YOUR DEBUGGING COMPANION</h1>

      <p>
        DevTools is built into every web browser and it's your best mate for
        understanding what's happening in your code. You can right-click on any
        webpage and select "Inspect" to open it up. It lets you see the HTML
        structure, CSS styling, watch JavaScript run in real-time, and catch
        errors before they become bigger problems. It's a behind the scenes look
        at websites.

      <h1>TO SUM IT UP</h1>

      <p>
        JavaScript transforms static web pages into dynamic, interactive
        experiences. Working in harmony with HTML and CSS, it handles all the
        logic and interactivity. Through the DOM, JavaScript can manipulate
        every element on your page, while DevTools gives you the power to debug
        and refine your code until it works exactly how you want it. JavaScript
        is JavaCool.
