      <h2>MY CULTURE & INFLUENCES</h2>

      <p>
        I grew up in Red Beach on the Hibiscus Coast, about half an hour north
        of central Auckland. It was a safe, easygoing community - beaches
        everywhere, and a real sense of freedom. This was the 90s, pre-social
        media and smartphones, when life felt a lot simpler. Cultural influence
        came mainly from the people around me - friends, family, the local
        community - and externally from what was on national TV and magazines.
      </p>
      <p>
        My friend group back then had its own strong values. We were a bit
        alternative, drawn to music, skating, surf culture - basically, living
        life for the fun of it and not following the crowd. Those friends are
        still really important to me today. They shaped so much of who I am and
        how I see the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being Pākehā and growing up in a very white family, I took a lot for
        granted. My parents and older brother are deeply kind hearted people,
        and I see how much of their influence I carry with me in my day to day -
        particularly in how I care for others and accept people from all walks
        of life. That said, it did take time to recognise how narrow my early
        lens was. Over the years, I’ve made a conscious effort to broaden that
        perspective beyond the default of being a white male in Aotearoa, and
        it’s something I will always keep working on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sport and music played a huge part in my childhood. I was an undiagnosed
        ADHD kid with energy to burn, and sport gave me a place to channel that.
        I was naturally athletic and always did well, and I think that’s where
        teamwork and shared success first became important values for me. At the
        same time, I played the trumpet through my school years - was pretty
        gifted at it too - and being in the concert band in high school taught
        me how to listen, contribute, and aim for excellence in a shared space.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I got older and the internet really took off, so did my exposure to
        new cultures, ideas, and movements. For a while I leaned into that -
        absorbing new ways of thinking, especially around identity, gender, and
        race. It helped me understand how narrow our personal perspectives can
        be, and the importance of stepping back, listening, and being open to
        challenge. Today I feel internet culture has shifted away from
        authenticity to algorithms and click-bait. The messages are still there
        and available but diluted from artificially created content and
        narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days, having entered my 40s, I rely more on my own compass.
        Friends, family, and community are still vital to me, but I’ve come to
        trust my own judgement more. I’m guided by the values shaped in my early
        life - kindness, creativity, fairness, inclusion - and keep refining
        them as I grow. The past gave me the tools, and now I use them to
        navigate life in a way that feels true to who I am today.

      <h2>PERSONAL STRENGTHS</h2>

      <p>
        I identify my core strengths as communication, empathy, work ethic,
        creativity, professional experience, and project management, as key in
        supporting my learning journey. Effective communication allows me to
        collaborate well with peers and facilitators, ensuring I stay engaged
        and can express ideas clearly. Empathy helps me understand others’
        perspectives, fostering better collaboration and deeper comprehension as
        well as wanting to see success in those around me. My proven strong work
        ethic will keep me focused and disciplined, enabling me to push through
        challenges and stay on track.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creativity will help me approach problems from innovative angles, while
        my professional experience gives me a solid foundation to apply new
        knowledge in practical scenarios. Additionally, my project management
        skills will ensure I stay organised, prioritise tasks effectively, and
        meet deadlines. These core strengths collectively will allow me to
        execute tasks efficiently, collaborate effectively with others, and
        remain adaptable and persistent in achieving my goals.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>PERSONAL LIMITATIONS</h2>

      <p>
        My limitations, such as self-doubt, putting others ahead of myself to my
        own detriment, overconfidence at times, and mental wellbeing, can
        certainly affect my learning and career development. Self-doubt has
        potential to hold me back, making it difficult to trust my abilities,
        which can prevent me from fully engaging with new opportunities. I
        sometimes hesitate to take action for fear of failure, limiting my
        potential before I even get started.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, putting others needs before my own can leave me feeling
        drained and distracted, impacting my ability to focus on my own growth.
        On the flip side, overconfidence can lead me to take on more than I can
        handle or overlook important details, which can hinder progress.
        Finally, general mental wellbeing can make it harder to maintain the
        energy and clarity needed to stay consistent in my learning journey.
        These limitations combined can slow my progress, but I am aware of them
        and am working to manage them to ensure they don’t prevent me from
        achieving my goals.

      <h2>PRODUCTIVITY RESISTANCE + TENSION</h2>

      <p>
        In a previous role, I was rapidly promoted from entry-level to
        management after returning to the company. I found myself overseeing
        communications, compliance, and scheduling across multiple divisions,
        including one led by a close friend of mine. I was eager to support his
        success, but my promotion inadvertently impacted his role, as I took on
        some of his managerial duties due to his struggles with managing
        expectations. This created tension, as he felt I was taking away
        opportunities from him, even though I was brought in to help alleviate
        his workload.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address this, I tried offering emotional and professional support,
        dedicating my personal time to listen, strategise, and offer advice. I
        thought this would help him manage his demanding workload, but over
        time, the situation became more strained. Despite keeping communication
        open and being there for him, it became clear he felt frustrated and
        blamed me for his lack of progress. Even after directly discussing the
        issue, he dismissed my concerns, which left me feeling stuck.
      </p>
      <p>
        In hindsight, I realise that while I was right to be empathetic, I
        should have established clearer boundaries between professionalism and
        personal support. I now understand that recognising the friction earlier
        and addressing it directly could have helped protect my own emotional
        investment. While the outcome might not have changed, setting firmer
        boundaries would have allowed me to maintain a healthier balance between
        my personal and professional roles.

      <h2>ETHICAL DECISION</h2>

      <p>
        In 2013 my grandmother, at 94 years old, suffered a severe stroke that
        left her immobile and unable to speak. Despite her tough and independent
        nature, having previously defied the odds after a heart attack, this
        stroke was different. She was no longer the lively, independent woman
        who zoomed around her neighbourhood on a mobility scooter, but instead,
        she faced the harsh reality of being reliant on others for everything.
        The doctors told us she might have a chance to recover, but it would
        mean a life of immobility and constant care. As a family, we were ready
        to provide her with whatever support she needed, but we had to respect
        her wishes.
      </p>
      <p>
        As she lay in the hospital, unable to communicate verbally, she made it
        clear that she didn’t want to live that life. Through her actions -
        removing her IV line and refusing medication - she was signalling that
        she had made her decision. It wasn’t an easy one for us, but we
        understood that she had lived life on her terms and this was no
        different. After discussing it with the family and the medical staff we
        made the decision to support her. It was heartbreaking, but we respected
        her choice, knowing it was her right to choose how she wanted to spend
        her final days.
      </p>
      <p>
        To this day I still admire the courage and strength she showed
        throughout the process. Her decision was made with clarity, and her
        resolve was something I will never forget. In the days that followed she
        passed away peacefully at my uncle’s home, surrounded by family, just as
        she had lived - fearlessly and on her own terms. I reflect on that
        experience with deep respect for her and pride in our family’s ability
        to honour her wishes, even through such immense grief. Her strength
        continues to inspire me, and I carry the lessons of her fierce
        independence and wisdom with me.

      <h2>TESTIMONIAL</h2>

      <p>
        In the 30+ years I’ve known Matthew I’ve seen him grow from an energetic
        and passionate young man into a truly kind, levelheaded and sincerely
        caring person.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve seen him face hardships and losses yet he has amazed me at his
        ability to hold a warmth and kindness towards the world that is truly a
        testament to his character. His strong eye for design and ascetics
        coupled with a drive for high level outcomes has always impressed me.
      </p>
      <p>I’m grateful to call him my friend.</p>
